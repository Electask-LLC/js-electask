# ELECTASK

Electask is an app to help counties manage election tasks. My hope is to make this app flexible, quick, and really user-friendly.

Another point to this app is to learn what goes into making a fullstack js app. There's some really cool stuff out there like Graphql-Yoga, Prisma, Apollo... but none of it really makes sense without a firm understanding of how node, express, and react can work together.

So that's the plan with this, recreate Electask with JS and learn the ins and outs of fullstackism.

### TODO
